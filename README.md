# Movie Recommendation System

I started by sourcing a comprehensive dataset from a reputable website, which included information on a wide range of movies. After thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering, I applied advanced machine learning algorithms to train the system.

The system's core functionality is to recommend movies similar to the user's preferences. It achieves this by analyzing their viewing history, preferred genres, directors, and actors. It then utilizes this data to generate personalized movie suggestions.

One of the key highlights of this project is its deployment on the Streamlit platform. Streamlit offers an intuitive and visually appealing web interface, making it accessible to a broad audience. Users can input their preferences, and within moments, the system provides them with a list of movies tailored to their tastes.
